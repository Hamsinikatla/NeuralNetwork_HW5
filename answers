1. GAN Architecture


## **Adversarial Process in GAN Training**

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are made of two neural networks:

1. **Generator (G)**  
2. **Discriminator (D)**

These two models are trained **together in a game-like scenario**, where they compete against each other:

- The **Generator** tries to create fake data that looks like real data.
- The **Discriminator** tries to tell the difference between real data (from the dataset) and fake data (from the Generator).

This is called an **adversarial process** because both models are trying to outsmart each other.


## **Goals of Each Component**

### **Generator (G)**  
- **Input**: Random noise (e.g., a vector of random numbers)  
- **Output**: Fake data (e.g., images, text, audio)  
- **Goal**: Generate fake data that is so realistic that the Discriminator thinks it’s real.

### **Discriminator (D)**  
- **Input**: Either real data (from the training set) or fake data (from the Generator)  
- **Output**: A probability (0 to 1) representing how real the data is  
- **Goal**: Correctly classify real vs. fake data.


## **How They Improve Through Competition**

1. **The Discriminator gets better** by learning to correctly identify fake data from real data.
2. **The Generator gets better** by learning to produce fake data that the Discriminator classifies as real.

This creates a **feedback loop**:

- If the Discriminator becomes too strong, the Generator can't learn.
- If the Generator becomes very good, the Discriminator can't tell real from fake (which is actually the goal).

**Ideal Outcome**:  
The Generator produces data that is **indistinguishable from real data**, and the Discriminator can’t do better than random guessing.

This competitive training helps both networks improve, pushing the Generator to become highly realistic and creative in generating data.
